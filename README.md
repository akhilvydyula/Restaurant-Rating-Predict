# Business Constraints and Problem Statement

- Automate RATINGS from textual comments and feedback, A machine learning model is created to predict rating of the restaurant reviews. The problem is that the review is in a textual form and the model should able ot predict by review and automate a result. 
- The main motive behind this project is to predict whether the given feedback or review in textual context is 1-5 range. 

- The basic approach was trying a different machine learning model and look for the one who is performing better on that data set. The restaurant reviews are very related to the project topic as reviews are made on websites and we can apply this model on such data sets to get the ratings.

### Task Definition

> To develop a machine learning model to predict rating contained in a collection of English sentences or a large paragraph.
1.LR
2.RF
3.ENSEMBLES
4.BERT
5.TFIDF
6.BOW

###  Result

MSE - 0.132

# Future Work

There is always a scope of improvement. Here are a few things which can be considered to improve. 
* Different models can also be tested.
* The remaining two models can be tuned for better results. For example, after plotting. AUC in  Logistic Regression we may get better results.
* Try a different data set. Sometimes a data set plays a crucial role too. 
* Some other tuning parameters to improve the accuracy of the model.
